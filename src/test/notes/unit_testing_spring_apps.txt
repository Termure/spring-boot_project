- Mockito is used to mock dependencies between controllers and service layers
- Repository layer is not tested using mockito because reporsitory layers does not have unit dependencies and is connected directly to the database.
  Repository will be tested using @DataJpaTest annotation which provides in memory database for testing.

@DataJpaTest annotation: 
  -tests only the persistence layer components
  -does not load other spring beans (@Components, @Controller, @Service, annotated beans) into ApplicationContext
  -the Spring IoC container (containing BeanFactory and ApplicationContext) is responsible for managing the objects of an application
   It uses dependency injection to achieve inversion of control 
  -all tests are transactional and roolback (data is cleaned up after each test)
